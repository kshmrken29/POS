## How to Apply to Other Files

To apply the new design to other files:

1. Remove Bootstrap CSS and JS links
2. Add a link to the `style.css` file: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/style.css">`
3. Replace the navigation bar with the new navbar structure:
   ```html
   <div class="navbar">
     <div class="navbar-container">
       <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.php">Restaurant POS - [Section]</a>
       <ul class="navbar-menu">
         <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="page1.php">Page 1</a></li>
         <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="page2.php">Page 2</a></li>
       </ul>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
4. Use the standard card layout:
   ```html
   <div class="card">
     <h3 class="card-title">Card Title</h3>
     <div>
       Card content goes here
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
5. Replace Bootstrap's grid system with the new card grid:
   ```html
   <div class="card-grid">
     <div class="card">Card 1</div>
     <div class="card">Card 2</div>
     <div class="card">Card 3</div>
   </div>
   ```
6. Use the standard form elements from `style.css`
7. Replace Bootstrap modals using the structure in the updated files
